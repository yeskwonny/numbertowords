## Introduction

This application, “Number to Words Converter,” transforms numeric input into the corresponding English words.
It allows users to interactively convert numbers up to a specific length limit(66digits) and view the results on a web interface.

## Chosen Approach

### Methodology

Ichose JavaScript for the conversion logic, implemented on the client side. This approach enables interactive testing directly in the browser, providing quick feedback to the user.
The algorithm chosen breaks down the number into segments (units, thousands, millions) and converts each part into words, then combines them into a complete phrase.

### Advantages

- **Interactivity**: Users can see results immediately after clicking "Convert," enhancing usability.
- **Speed**: Client-side processing reduces the need for a server, making it faster for users to interact with the tool.
- **Simplicity**: Using JavaScript keeps the solution lightweight and easy to run in any browser.

### Limitations

- **Character Limit**: This implementation supports numbers up to 66 digits.
- **Large Number Representation**: For numbers beyond the supported limit, the app displays “Extremely Large Number.”

## Alternative Solutions and Why They Were Not Selected

- **Using External Libraries**: Libraries like `number-to-words` exist for similar purposes, but a custom solution was preferred to give full control over the code. Avoiding external dependencies reduces setup requirements and ensures compatibility across environments.
